Dear {{ name }},

Thank you for your interest in our course. We understand that you are asking for a discount because {{ reason }}.

However, our view is that negotiating with everyone would be draining (and a distraction from just putting the course together). So this course has a blanket policy of not offering discounted tuition.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

{{ sender }}
